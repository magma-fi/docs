# A Native Stablecoin for DePINs

{% hint style="info" %}
`WEN` changed its name to `ioUSD` in November 2024. A more sensible name for a stablecoin on the IoTeX blockchain, home of DePIN.
{% endhint %}

Projected to become a $5 trillion market, DePIN is increasingly recognized as a pivotal evolution for cloud infrastructure. This burgeoning sector not only hosts a growing array of user and provider services and products but also attracts significant attention from leading research firms like Messari, Coinbase, Multicoin, and Pantera, which all forecast a surge in popularity and assets under management (AUM).

Central to this emerging DePIN story is the IoTeX network, renowned for its innovative blockchain solutions linking physical and digital assets.Despite these promising projections, DePIN projects often faces a hurdle that underscores a broader issue hampering mass adoption - the requirement for users to purchase volatile tokens to access DePIN services.

#### Magma - The Native Stablecoin for DePINs

Magma is a DeFi protocol that enables users to mint a stablecoin, WEN. Fully collateralized by IOTX and the liquid staking token (LST) uniIOTX, WEN opens DeFi doors for projects and users alike through providing a native stable asset for the ecosystem.

Native stablecoins in DePIN ecosystems serve several vital roles that transcend simple transactional functions. They provide DePIN users with a stable and straightforward exchange medium, drastically reducing entry barriers and enhancing accessibility by mitigating the typical volatility of cryptocurrencies. As intrinsic assets of their blockchains, these stablecoins are free from the risks tied to cross-chain bridges, such as hacking, thereby bolstering transaction security and reliability. Leveraging IOTX and its derivatives as collateral, these stablecoins not only maintain their value but also boost the demand for IOTX, fostering a vibrant economic cycle that enhances its utility throughout the ecosystem.

### 1 WEN = $1

WEN has a floor price of $1 USD and when it falls below that price, anyone can profit by buying WEN below $1 and selling into IOTX at $1 USD. The stability pool also allows for users to profit by providing a buffer for redemptions and liquidations that occur to maintain the peg.

The protocol mechanism, from [Liquity](https://www.liquity.org/), allows for an over-collateralised and censorship resistant stablecoin to be used for DeFi activities on-chain. Through its design, and use of on-chain liquid assets and LSTs, Magma and WEN reduces pricing and security risks versus bridged-USDT as a self-contained asset.

Before WEN arrived on IoTeX, only bridged stable assets were available and these are vulnerable to the usual smart contract risks and are entirely dependent on bridge reliability and security. The history of DeFi has shown that bridges are a common attack vector for bad actors, so removing this risk for stable assets on IoTeX bolsters the reliability for stable pools; with WEN becoming a prominent DeFi asset on-chain.

DePIN projects looking to create buying and trading opportunities for their tokens and services must rely on liquidity solutions on-chain, so by bringing WEN to the ecosystem there now exists a solution that is tied to the success of all projects through the native IOTX token. This is demonstrated by the proven, battle-tested code used in Magma’s adoption of Liquity’s codebase. Decentralisation is only possible when each part of a system is sufficiently decentralised, so WEN fills this gap and removes the risks of external tokens brought to bear on DeFi and DePIN activities on IoTeX.

### MGM coming

Finally, the project token for Magma, MGM, is yet to be launched, and when it does a portion of the MGM will be distributed to those who have supported the genesis phase of the WEN stablecoin. This initial MGM distribution to the community is being determined by the Magma Points currently being earned by those providing liquidity to DePIN projects in WEN pairs, and to those providing WEN to the stability pool. Furthermore, those referring other users to the protocol are also earning Magma Points for their efforts in encouraging further growth of WEN and enhancing the robustness of WEN’s peg. Simply depositing IOTX to collateralise the stablecoin, and securing some of this WEN in the stability pool, is enough to earn points for the coming MGM launch.

### Next steps

Next steps for Magma include the introduction of uniIOTX as collateral for WEN. This will enable significant asset flows into WEN, increasing the market cap and visibility of WEN and provide further earning opportunities for IoTeX LSTs.

_Magma has the main goal of providing a DeFi backbone for IoTeX using a community-powered stablecoin as the foundation._
