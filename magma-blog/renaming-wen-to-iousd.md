# Renaming WEN to ioUSD

When we launched Magma, our goal was to provide a stablecoin for IoTeX that is backed by the native token on-chain - IOTX The Magma stablecoin was called WEN, but this has changed! We are pleased to announce and welcome ioUSD to IoTeX.

We initially named our dollar-pegged token, $WEN, because of its history with coinage in Imperial China. That history includes the Silk Road so will be forever tied to digital trading history. (It was also a cheeky swipe at the Solana memecoin of the same name. A touch of levity.

Solana is another proponent of DePIN, and with memecoins dominating their current landscape, it was a playful homage. Solana clearly also have robust and worthy projects too, including DePIN! Because DePIN is valuable and IoTeX is DePIN-centric.

With this in mind, and realising the use of a memecoin name was easily misconstrued by our on-chain brethren, we thought a change was needed. We are here to bring [#DeFi4DePIN](https://x.com/hashtag/DeFi4DePIN?src=hashtag\_click) and to do so in a professional manner.

#### In conclusion

The WEN stablecoin from Magma will be deprecated and the ioUSD token is here in its place - for supporting DePIN on IoTeX.

* Collateralise assets to mint ioUSD
* Swap to ioUSD on [Mimo Exchange](https://mimo.exchange)
* Stake ioUSD for rewards and MagmaPoints

[#DeFi4DePIN](https://x.com/hashtag/DeFi4DePIN?src=hashtag\_click) is Magma

> ioUSD is pegged to 1 USD, is on IoTeX, so it makes more sense to just call it ioUSD

See you on-chain. Rewards are waiting.
