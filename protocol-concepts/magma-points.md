# Magma Points

To encourage and reward early participation in Magma Protocol, there is the opportunity to earn Magma Points. WEN holders who stake in the Stability Pool, provide liquidity to the IOTX/WEN pair on Mimo, and refer new users to do the same, all qualify for Magma points.

* Stability Pool WEN - 10 Magma Points per WEN per hour
* IOTX/WEN - 10 Magma Points per USD per hour
* Referrals - 10% of referred users' accumulated points
* (ETA 17th March) DePIN Liquidity Hub - GEOD/WEN, XNET/WEN, WIFI/WEN, 10 Magma Points per USD per hour

{% hint style="success" %}
Referral points (10%) are gained for each point earned by a referred user who stakes in the Stability Pool or IOTX/WEN LP.
{% endhint %}

Magma Points earning will continue until MGM is released.
