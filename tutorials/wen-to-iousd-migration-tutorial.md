# WEN to ioUSD Migration Tutorial

Minting the Magma stablecoin (ioUSD) will be possible using collateralised debt positions on Magma in the same way as WEN operated previously. ioUSD is replacing the WEN token. It is a nomenclature change to help identify the Magma stablecoin as an asset pegged to 1 USD.

### Below are three ways to manage holding WEN and migrate away from this previous iteration of the Magma stablecoin.&#x20;

1. Users with Magma positions (IOTX debt positions to mint WEN) can repay the WEN and redeem IOTX in [Magma->Borrow WEN](https://app.magma.finance/).

2. WEN holders without Magma positions can swap their WEN on a dex ([mimo.exchange](https://mimo.exchange))

3. WEN can also be redeemed on [Magma->Stake WEN->Exchange WEN For IOTX ](https://app.magma.finance/stake)for the equivalent value of IOTX (WEN at a price of $1)
