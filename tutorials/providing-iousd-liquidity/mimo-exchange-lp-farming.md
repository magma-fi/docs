# Mimo Exchange LP Farming

#### WIOTX/ioUSD

There are two steps to complete in order to farm liquidity rewards on Mimo. Firstly, adding liquidity to the WIOTX/ioUSD pool, secondly, staking your liquidity tokens in the farm.

### Adding liquidity to the Mimo pool

* Visit [mimo.exchange/farm](https://mimo.exchange/farm) and connect your wallet.

* Next, select "add liquidity" for WIOTX/ioUSD.

* Tokens are added to liquidity pools with each half of the pool worth the same amount (in $). So if you added $50 of ioUSD then you will need to add $50 of WIOTX to make the liquidity pair. The interface will calculate this for you. (If you need to swap tokens to have enough for pairing, you can use the Swap function on a DEX of your choice.)
* Choose how many tokens you wish to pair and complete the transaction in your wallet.

If this is the first time you are interacting with ioUSD and IOTX on Mimo you will need to approve each token.

Check the URL carefully.

mimo.exchange is the correct domain.

{% hint style="warning" %}
You also need to choose spending allowance caps for each token. This gives permission for the contracts to spend, on your instruction, up to that amount. E.g. If you are trying to deposit 1000 IOTX and only set the spending allowance to 500, you won't be able to.

_You have now provided liquidity!_ Each trade that uses this liquidity pool will earn you a fraction of its value.

### Adding liquidity to a Mimo farm

Next is to stake your LP Tokens (Liquidity Provider Tokens) into the farm.

* Select "Stake WIOTX/ioUSD".

* The pop-up will ask how many of your LP Tokens to stake in the farming pool. (The more you stake, the more rewards you can get from the farming aspect. "Max" is the usual selection.)

#### Please note:

{% hint style="info" %}
Even though the pool is called "WIOTX/ioUSD" (Wrapped IOTX and ioUSD), the Mimo interface will manage IOTX token wrapping for you.

Wrapping IOTX simply makes the network token usable by smart contracts.

WIOTX is valued 1:1 to IOTX.

_You are now farming LP rewards with your LP Tokens on Mimo Exchange._
