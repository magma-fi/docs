# Izumi Finance LP Farming



There are two farms available for ioUSD liquidity on Izumi. One is IOTX/ioUSD, a volatile pairing, and the other is a stable pairing, ioUSD/USDC.e.

#### Adding Liquidity

* Visit the Farms page on Izumi, [https://izumi.finance/farm/iZi/dynamic](https://izumi.finance/farm/iZi/dynamic), and connect your wallet (ensure you are on the IoTeX network in your wallet or the Izumi app settings).
* Next, select the dropdown arrow for the liquidity pairing you want.
* Then select "Add Liquidity" for the pair you've chosen (USDC.e/ioUSD in this example).

* Tokens are added to liquidity pools with each half of the pool worth the same amount (in $). So if you added $50 of ioUSD then you will need to add $50 of USDC.e to make the liquidity pair. The interface will calculate this for you. (If you need to swap tokens to have enough for pairing, you can use the Swap function on a DEX of your choice.)
* Choose how many tokens you wish to pair and complete the transaction in your wallet.

If this is the first time you are interacting with ioUSD, USDC.e or IOTX on Izumi you will need to approve each token.

Check the URL carefully.

izumi.finance is the correct domain.

{% hint style="warning" %}
You also need to choose spending allowance caps for each token. This gives permission for the contracts to spend, on your instruction, up to that amount. E.g. If you are trying to deposit 1000 IOTX and only set the spending allowance to 500, you won't be able to.
