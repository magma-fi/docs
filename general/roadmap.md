# Roadmap

### Phase 1: Minting `ioUSD` using `IOTX` - complete

Collateralizing `IOTX` to mint `ioUSD` is scheduled for late 2023. This can be considered an early release or beta version. Minting will be limited to 1,000 `ioUSD` during this testing period.

Please note there are always risks associated with smart contracts. Please be aware of the risks involved with any blockchain and smart contract interactions done in any financial market. Do not trade with money that you cannot afford to lose. When in doubt, you should always consult a qualified financial advisor before making any investment decisions.

### Phase 1a: Increase `ioUSD` minting limits - complete

Users will be able to mint sums greater than 1000 `ioUSD`.

### Phase 2: Minting `ioUSD` using uniIOTX - complete

Bedrock LST, uniIOTX will be enabled as a collateral asset, opening DeFi activities for those looking to maintain exposure to IOTX and explore more of Web3.

### Phase 3: Consolidation - ongoing

Working with IoTeX and other protocols to increase the status and usage of DeFi protocols on IoTeX blockchain.

### Phase 4: `ioUSD` deposit rewards and sustainable real yield - ongoing

This will see Magma enabling deposit rewards for `ioUSD`. The income to support these rewards will be sustainably earned through the underlying LST.

We are also looking to work closely with IoTeX to embrace ecosystem growth campaigns, build our community and user-base. Points and loyalty will be rewarded in the future as a result of activities undertaken before our TGE.

### Phase 4: DAO governance and platform token - pending

The Magma Protocol governance framework and platform token will be released in late Q2 2024.

{% hint style="success" %}
Early participants (particularly in Phase 1) can expect Phase 3 to bring a gesture of gratitude from the protocol. Any munificence from Magma is wholly discretionary, and any attempt to subvert the ethos of DeFi could result in exclusions from future rewards, airdrops and other benefits for individuals or all participants.

We believe DeFi is an equitable paradigm where good actors should be rewarded, while malefactors are denied access and are excluded from participation.
