# What is Magma

## **What is Magma?**

Magma is a brand new DeFi primitive focused on realizing the full potential of liquid staking tokens (LSTs) and real world assets (RWAs). Magma enables users to mint a stablecoin, **`ioUSD`,** that is fully collateralized by liquid staking tokens.&#x20;

Magma Protocol builds from [Liquity's economic model](https://github.com/liquity/dev) to ensure efficient borrowing and timely liquidations. Magma has an unique multi-collateral design in which each position has a single collateral type, but they are all linked to the same stability pool.

These features make it attractive for those wanting to get the best out of their LSTs without tail risks from other stablecoins.&#x20;

Magma Protocol is non-custodial and governance-minimised, with the goal of becoming immutable. Its codebase is completely immutable, based on Liquity, creating a robust protocol and truly decentralized stablecoin with favorable and flexible collateral parameters. The Magma DAO will be in charge of parameters, emissions, and protocol fees.

## What are the main use cases of Magma?

1. Borrow `ioUSD` against `IOTX` by opening a Vault
2. Secure Magma by providing `ioUSD` to the [Stability Pool](protocol-concepts/stability-pool-and-liquidations.md) in exchange for rewards
3. Stake $MGM to earn the fee revenue paid for minting or redeeming `ioUSD`
4. Redeem `1 ioUSD` for `1 USD` worth of `IOTX` when the `ioUSD` peg falls below `$1`
