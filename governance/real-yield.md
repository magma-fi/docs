<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>A diagram shows real yield flow originated from IOTX voting.</p></figcaption></figure>

The IOTX collateral users post against ioUSD will be sent by Magma to Bedrock to earn rewards from IOTX voting.&#x20;

So users will not only earn $MGM emissions but also IOTX from voting rewards and ioUSD from platform revenues.

## Ecosystem Incentives

Magma will allocates $MGM and part of the LSD yields to ecosystem partners to incentivise liquidity for the following DEX trading pairs:&#x20;

ioUSD - USDC

MGM - IOTX
